h3. 1) Introduction

Log4Play is a module that provides a log4j appender which publishes log entries to an EventStream. 
The module also provides an user interface which uses a WebSocket creating a live stream of log messages.
You can use this user interface to look at the logs of your application without needing to login to the actual box.



h3. 2) Installation

Under dependencies.yml:

require:
    - play -> log4play 0.0.1



h3. 3) Live Demo

A live demo is available at http://log4play.mashup.fm:9030/@logs. 
As soon as you enable the module on your application you should have the same UI available as well under /@logs.



h3. 4) Source Code

The source code is available on Github at https://github.com/feliperazeek/log4play.



h3. 5) Changelog

May 13th 2011 - Version 0.0.1: First Release.



h3. 6) Roadmap

* Extend the UI to listen on multiple WebSockets to allow to receive messages from a whole cluster.
